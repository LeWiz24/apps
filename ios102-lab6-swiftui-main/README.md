## Unit 6 Lab: FireChat

### Overview

In this lab, you'll embark on a journey to create FireChat, a dynamic SwiftUI-powered chat app that harnesses the power of Firebase Firestore as its custom backend server. This app will allow users to engage in real-time conversations within an interactive chat environment. Drawing on your experience working with Parse, you'll find that the transition to Firebase with Firestore brings new opportunities for seamless, synchronized communication. So grab a bucket of water, because this Firebase-powered app is about to bring the heat ðŸ”¥
